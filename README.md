# Visualization of PISA Dataset in 2012

### Summary
This visualization used PISA dataset, which assessed the extent to which 15-year-old students have acquired key knowledge and skills that are essential for full participation in modern societies. And I mainly explored the strength of relationship between math score and social-economic status. The countries are divided into 9 groups due to their math score and strength of relationship.

### Design

- story I want to tell: 
	- Different countries varied in math performance. And the influence of social-economic status to math performance was different in each country. Like, Peru and some Latin American countries had bad math performance and less equity compared with other countries. 
	- I tried to express the same idea as Figure II.1.2 on [PISA 2012 Results: Excellence Through Equity: Giving Every Student the Chance to Succeed (Volume II)](http://www.oecd.org/pisa/keyfindings/pisa-2012-results-volume-ii.htm), which was in the form of a scatterplot.
- chart type: I choose to use a choropleth map for the main part and I was inspired by the graphs in [this article](http://uk.businessinsider.com/income-and-racial-inequality-maps-2015-5?r=US&IR=T). Also, I added two barcharts to show exactly how students behaved and how strong the relationship was in each country. Further, a scatterplot to explain how the "equity" was calculated.
- visual encodings: 
	- choropleth map:
		- map: showing geological information
		- color: showing both math performance and variance explained by social-economic status
	- barchart:
		- bar width(x axis): showing the mean math score or the strength of the relationship in each country
		- y axis: different countries
	- scatterplot:
		- x axis: the index of social-economic status
		- y axis: the mean math score
		- line: the regresssion line
- interaction: When hovering on one country, then relative information would pop up, including mean math score, strength of relationship between math score and social-economic status. People can also switch between the two barcharts.
- changes after collecting feedbackï¼š
	- Add another barchart showing strength of the relationship. I also added buttons to allow users switch between these two barcharts easily.
	- Add average line to barcharts.

### Feedback
1. Add the barchart of strength of the relationship, since there were two dimensions on the map. 
2. Add average line to the barchart.

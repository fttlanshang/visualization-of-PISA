### Summary
in no more than 4 sentences, briefly introduce your data visualization and add any context that can help readers understand it

### Design

- story I want to tell: different countries varied in math performance and the influence of social-economic status to math performance. xx country is xx type and xx follows xx pattern. And social-economic status is an important factor in predicting performance.
- chart type: I choose to use a choropleth map and I was inspired by the graphs in [this article](http://uk.businessinsider.com/income-and-racial-inequality-maps-2015-5?r=US&IR=T).
- visual encodings: 
	- map: showing geological information
	- color: showing both math performance and variance explained by social-economic status
	- circle size(maybe): show the math performance gap related to gender
